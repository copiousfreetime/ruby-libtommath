== DESCRIPTION

ruby-libtommath is an extension which includes the {LibTomMath}[http://libtom.org/?page=features&newsitems=5&whatfile=ltm]
free open source portable number theoretic multiple-precision integer library.

Yes, the libtommath library is included directly in the extension, 
no need for the external library.

An ALMOST drop in replacement for the built in ruby Bignum.
Overall the LibTomMath library is faster, can handler larger
numbers and has more features than the built in ruby Bignum.  
There are a few slight differences in behavior and those are documented 
in the LibTom::Math::Bignum class.

See the LibTom::Math, LibTom::Math::Bignum and LibTom::Math::Prime 
sections for more information.

== CREDITS

All the credit goes to Tom St. Denis for creating the {LibTom}[http://libtom.org] 
projects in the first place.
